# Houston-Crime-Analysis

The exploration of crime data within urban settings is crucial for understanding the multifaceted nature of crime and its impacts on communities. In Houston, a city with a diverse socio-economic landscape, analyzing crime data from 2019 to 2024 provides a unique opportunity to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and correlations. This report aims to dissect these patterns, identify hotspots and temporal trends in criminal activity, and integrate socio-economic and demographic data to offer a broader perspective on the factors influencing crime. By employing a variety of data analysis techniques, from preprocessing to advanced visualisation, the goal of this project is to provide actionable insights that can inform public safety strategies, policy formulation, and community interventions. This endeavour not only highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in urban planning and public safety but also underscores the potential of analytics in fostering a safer, more informed community.
